## Demo

## Details for teaching team
First time I've used Bootstrap so I've been trying to find out as many tips to avoid at all costs creating my own stylesheet to override Bootstrap (many cases this would've been faster for me, but I wanted to learn to play within Bootstrap). Really cool to use Bootstrap!
